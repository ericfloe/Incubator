# Incubator
Incubator2 contains the node.js code for a completely automated  Egg Incubation process.  This includes the monitoring and feeback loops for the temperature and humidity.  Since a lack of humidity indicates the lack of H2O this simply triggers the pump to add water to the reservoir.   All of the factors are displayed on the LCD screen with color coded indicators and an aubible alarm for the extreme reporting cases.  Finally, the IncubatorTurner code was implemented to control the actual rotation of the eggs 4 full cycles in a 24 hour period to promote health development. All of these factors are pushed to the cloud for remote monitoring through a mobile application.  This was built on the Intel Edision IoT Platform.
